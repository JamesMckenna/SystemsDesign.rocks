#### DotNet Core 3.1 Identity Managerment and Secure Token Serve project

<p>The project structure was decided on to demostrate some different programming skills. If I was to design and build out a full enterprise identity management and secure token server, I wouldn't structue the project in the same way. As it is now, it serves as a good technical disscusion - best design for deployment, horizontal or verticale scaling and how best to contaierize are questions that come to mind.</p>
