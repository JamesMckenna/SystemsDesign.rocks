FOR: IdentityCommon Library & IdentityDataCommon Library


User Account: UserManager - complete
RoleManager - TODO
Admin Management: UserManager - TODO
SigninManager - currently IS4, consider moving to IdApi


Might not need this class library. Attempt to move ALL Identity related classes to IdApi
IF this/these Apps (IS4, IdManagement, IdApi) continue to use this library, then remove duplicate classes. EG: This class library contains a ChangePassword.cs, as does IdManagement.Models
